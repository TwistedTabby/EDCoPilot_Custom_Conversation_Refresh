## Product Overview

**Product Name**: EDCopilot Conversation Refresher  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Document Owner**: Development Team  
**Last Updated**: 2024  

### Executive Summary
The EDCopilot Conversation Refresher is an automated system designed to generate and update custom chit chat files for the EDCopilot platform. The system will leverage AI language models (OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude) to create fresh, engaging conversation content that keeps users interested and maintains platform engagement.

### Problem Statement
Current custom chit chat content in EDCopilot becomes stale over time, reducing user engagement and platform value. Manual content creation is time-intensive and inconsistent, requiring an automated solution to maintain fresh conversation experiences.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Automate Content Generation**: Eliminate manual effort in creating chit chat content
2. **Maintain User Engagement**: Provide fresh conversation content to keep users interested
3. **Reduce Operational Overhead**: Minimize time spent on content maintenance
4. **Ensure Content Quality**: Maintain appropriate and engaging conversation standards

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- 100% automated generation of 4 custom chatter file types
- Weekly/bi-weekly content refresh cycle achievement
- Zero deployment failures or content corruption
- Cost-effective API usage within defined budgets
- Improved user engagement metrics with fresh content
